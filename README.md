Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Basic Attendance Tracker Project.

This is a simple little Python program I built to help manage student attendance. It's a command-line tool, so you just run it from your terminal, and it does the rest. It was a really cool way for me to practice some fundamental Python skills like working with files and handling user input.
I think this project is a great fit for the Operations Lead or Data Lead roles because it shows how I can build something to keep track of important information (like who showed up to a session!) and manage data in a neat, organized way.

ðŸš€ What it Does

Easy Entry: You can quickly record an attendance entry for a student by just typing in their ID and status (P or A).
Organized Data: All the attendance records get saved into a simple CSV file, which acts like a mini-database.
Smarter Design: I added some basic checks to make sure you can't enter a wrong status, which keeps the data clean.

ðŸ’» How to Get Started

Grab the code:
Bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd [repository_name]


Make a file: Create an empty attendance_logs.csv file in the same folder.
Run the magic! âœ¨
Bash
python attendance_tracker.py



ðŸ§  Under the Hood

This project was a great way for me to practice using Python 3 along with its built-in csv and datetime libraries.

What's Next?

This is just the start! In the future, I'd love to add a few more features, like generating a full attendance report for a specific day or a particular student. I might even try to build a simple graphical interface one day!
